# PLANNING.md

## Purpose
This document outlines the high-level vision, architecture, and steps for building AI agents using the AI SDK (ai toolkit) with OpenAI as the provider. It is based on the official toolkit documentation and best practices for scalable, maintainable AI-powered applications.

---

## Vision & Goals
- Build modular, extensible AI agents leveraging the AI SDK for seamless integration with OpenAI models.
- Support both backend (API) and frontend (UI) agent interactions.
- Enable rapid prototyping and production-ready deployment using Next.js and React.
- Ensure maintainability, testability, and clear separation of concerns.

---

## Architecture Overview
- **Core AI SDK**: Provides unified API for model providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.).
- **Provider Layer**: We use `@ai-sdk/openai` for OpenAI model access.
- **UI Layer**: Uses `@ai-sdk/react` for chat and generative UI hooks (framework-agnostic, but we use React/Next.js).
- **API Layer**: Next.js API routes (e.g., `/api/chat/route.ts`) handle streaming and agent orchestration.
- **Environment**: Requires Node.js 18+, pnpm, and relevant API keys in `.env`.

---

## Key Steps for Agent Development
1. **Install Dependencies**
   - `pnpm add ai @ai-sdk/openai @ai-sdk/react`
2. **Set Up Environment**
   - Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to `.env`.
3. **Implement Core Agent Logic**
   - Use `generateText` or `streamText` from `ai` with the OpenAI provider.
   - Define system prompts and agent instructions.
4. **Build API Endpoints**
   - Create Next.js API routes (e.g., `/api/chat/route.ts`) to handle chat requests and stream responses.
5. **Create UI Components**
   - Use `useChat` from `@ai-sdk/react` to build chat interfaces.
   - Display messages, handle user input, and manage chat state.
6. **Test and Iterate**
   - Use provided templates and examples for rapid prototyping.
   - Write unit and integration tests for agent logic and endpoints.
7. **Deploy and Monitor**
   - Deploy using Vercel or preferred platform.
   - Monitor usage, errors, and iterate on agent capabilities.

---

## Best Practices
- Keep agent logic modular and configurable.
- Use environment variables for API keys and secrets.
- Leverage streaming for responsive UIs.
- Write clear system prompts and document agent behavior.
- Use the AI SDK community and templates for support and inspiration.
